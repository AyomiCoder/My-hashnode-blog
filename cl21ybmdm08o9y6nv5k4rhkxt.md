## Preparing for the Tech Space!

It all started in 2018, as a fresh secondary school graduate hanging on the shores of a dilemma*(not knowing which step to take because I didn't register for jamb that year)*, I had limited access to computers and the only point of access is my church, as a member of the media crew. I started learning graphics design on my own, which at some point was discouraging, it all looked like I wasn't making any progress but I was really consistent with it. 

A few months after consistent practice, I started working in a cyber cafe as a graphics designer, my primary job is to design complimentary cards, banners, invitation cards e.t.c. I earned experience and added more to my knowledge as I work from place to place. On a Wednesday evening, I was scrolling through opera news and I saw headline news of a 22-yr-old boy who built an app and sold it for $1m in China, I was really impressed and curious to know how he did it, after a few google searches, I came across the word "Software development" and other areas of specializations in tech, I had no laptop even if I want to start coding but I took a bold step and started learning on my phone, I started with HTML and I was feeling myself after learning how to use some tags to make an output of "Hello world" ðŸ˜‚. I updated a WhatsApp status writing ```<!Doctype html>``` and I got a message from a friend of mine studying computer science at a college in Manchester, UK saying *Welcome to web development*, It was then I discovered there is a lot to uncover, and the journey began...... 

I got a laptop from my uncle after 8 months of learning on phone, it was another puzzle but I got along with it, I met my mentor, Tejumola Timi(a Software Developer), and he was guiding me all along and sending me data to study online courses. In 2020, I gained admission to study English(B.A) at Olabisi Onabanjo University, classes robbed me of time and I had very little time to practice but I was still consistent. I have built a few websites too, and lastly, Twitter has really helped me because I have access to a lot of information that aided my learning. 

Now I'm currently learning React javascript.
